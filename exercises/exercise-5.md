# Exercise 5

## Requirements

**Requirement 1.** Fully implement the "Save" and "Cancel" buttons in the Car Edit Row component. When the "Save" button is clicked, save the changes to the list of cars. When the "Cancel" button is clicked, revert the changes back to the original.

- Hint: Find index of the original, and replace the original at that index.

**Requirement 2.** If one of the table rows is being edited, the edit row should change to a view row after, a car is added, or a car is deleted, or a car is saved. For the add or delete operations, the changes for the car being edited should not be saved.

Ensure it works!
